Citric acid plays a crucial role in soap making by acting as a chelating agent. It helps bind metal ions present in water, which can otherwise interfere with the soap's lathering ability and cause soap scum. By incorporating citric acid into the soap recipe, soap makers can improve the soap's performance in hard water conditions, ensuring a better lather and a more effective cleansing experience. Additionally, citric acid can help adjust the pH level of the soap, making it gentler on the skin. This makes it a valuable ingredient for enhancing the overall quality and user experience of handmade soaps.
