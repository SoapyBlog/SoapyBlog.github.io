To create a cool and refreshing scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of freshness and invigoration. Peppermint, eucalyptus, and spearmint are excellent choices for their crisp and revitalizing aromas. You can blend these with citrus oils like lemon or lime to add a zesty note that enhances the overall freshness. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a cooling and energizing experience, perfect for waking up in the morning or refreshing yourself after a long day.
