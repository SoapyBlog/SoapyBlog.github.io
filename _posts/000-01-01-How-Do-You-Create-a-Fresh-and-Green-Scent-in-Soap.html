To create a fresh and green scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of nature and vitality. Essential oils like lemongrass, basil, and rosemary are excellent choices for their crisp and invigorating aromas. You can blend these with a hint of citrus or floral notes to add brightness and balance. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a refreshing and revitalizing experience, perfect for those who enjoy a connection to nature in their fragrance.
