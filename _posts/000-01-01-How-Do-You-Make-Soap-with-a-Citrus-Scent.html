To make soap with a citrus scent, start by selecting essential oils that capture the fresh and invigorating aroma of citrus fruits. Popular choices include lemon, orange, grapefruit, and lime essential oils. These oils can be used individually or blended to create a unique citrus fragrance. When adding the essential oils to the soap mixture, do so at a low temperature to preserve their aromatic properties. Additionally, consider incorporating finely grated citrus zest for added texture and a burst of natural scent. The result is a vibrant and refreshing soap that invigorates the senses with its zesty citrus aroma.
