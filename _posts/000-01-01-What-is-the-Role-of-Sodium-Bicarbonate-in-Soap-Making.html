Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is used in soap making for its gentle exfoliating and deodorizing properties. It helps to neutralize odors and can enhance the cleansing power of soap. Sodium bicarbonate is also valued for its ability to soften water, which can improve the soap's lathering ability and make it more effective in hard water conditions. By incorporating sodium bicarbonate, soap makers can create products that offer a refreshing and invigorating cleansing experience, leaving the skin feeling clean and revitalized.
