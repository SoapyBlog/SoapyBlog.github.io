Lye, also known as caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), is a crucial ingredient in the soap-making process, acting as a catalyst for the chemical reaction known as saponification. This reaction occurs when lye is mixed with fats or oils, transforming them into soap and glycerin. Without lye, the oils would not convert into soap, meaning its presence is essential for creating solid soap bars. While lye itself is a highly caustic substance, it becomes neutralized during the saponification process, leaving no harmful residue in the finished product. Soap makers must handle lye with care, using protective gear and precise measurements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Understanding the role of lye helps in appreciating the science behind soap making, resulting in a product that cleanses and nourishes the skin.
