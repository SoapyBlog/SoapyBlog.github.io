The hot process method is a traditional technique for making soap that involves cooking the soap mixture to speed up the saponification process. In this method, oils and lye are combined and then heated, typically in a slow cooker or double boiler. The heat accelerates the chemical reaction, allowing the soap to reach a gel-like consistency more quickly. Once the mixture reaches this stage, it is poured into molds. Unlike the cold process method, hot process soap can be used almost immediately after it cools and hardens, as the saponification is complete during the cooking phase. This method is popular among soap makers who want to create rustic-looking bars with a shorter curing time. It also allows for the addition of fragrances and additives after the cooking process, which can help preserve their scent and properties.
