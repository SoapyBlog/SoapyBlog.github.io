Creating a soap with a light and airy scent involves selecting fragrances that are subtle yet uplifting. Essential oils like lavender, bergamot, and chamomile are excellent choices for their delicate and soothing aromas. You can blend these with a hint of citrus or floral notes to add a touch of brightness. When making the soap, incorporate these scents into the base mixture, ensuring they are evenly distributed. The result is a soap that envelops you in a gentle, refreshing aroma, perfect for a calming and serene bathing experience.
