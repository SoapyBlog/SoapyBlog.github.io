The cold process method is a popular technique for making soap from scratch. It involves mixing oils and lye, which then undergo a chemical reaction called saponification. This process creates soap without the need for external heat, hence the name "cold process." The mixture is poured into molds and left to cure for several weeks or months. This curing time allows the soap to harden and develop its full lathering and cleansing properties. Cold process soap making allows for greater control over the ingredients, enabling the inclusion of natural additives like essential oils, herbs, and colorants. This method is favored by many for its ability to produce high-quality, customizable soaps.
