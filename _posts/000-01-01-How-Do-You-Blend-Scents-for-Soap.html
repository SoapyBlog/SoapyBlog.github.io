Blending scents for soap involves combining different essential oils or fragrance oils to create a unique aroma. Start by selecting a few scents that complement each other. It's helpful to understand the basic categories of scents, such as floral, citrus, woody, and spicy, to create a balanced blend. Begin with small amounts and use a dropper to add oils to a mixing container, adjusting the ratio until you achieve the desired fragrance. It's important to test the blend by adding a few drops to a small batch of soap to ensure the scent holds up during the soap-making process. Keep notes on the amounts used for future reference and experimentation. Remember, the key to a successful scent blend is balance and harmony, ensuring no single note overpowers the others.
