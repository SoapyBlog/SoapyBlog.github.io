To make soap with a floral and fruity scent, start by selecting fragrance oils that capture the sweet and vibrant aromas of flowers and fruits. Popular choices include rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang for floral notes, and peach, apple, and mango for fruity notes. These can be blended to create a balanced and harmonious fragrance profile. When adding the fragrance oils to the soap mixture, do so at a low temperature to preserve their aromatic properties. Consider incorporating natural colorants like beetroot powder or spirulina to enhance the visual appeal of the soap. The result is a delightful soap that exudes a sweet, floral, and fruity scent, perfect for a refreshing and uplifting bathing experience.
