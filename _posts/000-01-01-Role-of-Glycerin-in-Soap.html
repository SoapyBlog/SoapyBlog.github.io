Glycerin plays a crucial role in soap, acting as a natural humectant that helps retain moisture in the skin. During the soap-making process, glycerin is produced as a byproduct of saponification, the chemical reaction that turns fats and oils into soap. Its moisturizing properties make it an essential component in many skincare products, as it helps prevent dryness and keeps the skin feeling soft and smooth. Glycerin is also known for its gentle nature, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. By attracting water from the air into the skin's outer layer, glycerin ensures that the skin remains hydrated and healthy. This makes glycerin-rich soaps a popular choice for those looking to maintain their skin's natural moisture balance.
