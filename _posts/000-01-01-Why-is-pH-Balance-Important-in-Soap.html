The pH balance in soap is crucial for maintaining the health and integrity of your skin. The skin's natural pH is slightly acidic, typically around 5.5, which helps protect against harmful bacteria and maintain moisture. When soap is too alkaline, it can disrupt the skin's natural barrier, leading to dryness, irritation, and even infections. A soap with a balanced pH helps ensure that it cleans effectively without damaging the skin's protective layer. Therefore, choosing or making soap with the right pH balance is essential for skincare, providing a gentle yet effective cleansing experience.
