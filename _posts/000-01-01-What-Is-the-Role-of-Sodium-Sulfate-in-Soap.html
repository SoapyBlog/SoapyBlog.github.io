Sodium sulfate is often used in soap making, primarily as a filler that helps bulk up the soap, reducing the cost of production. While this might seem like a beneficial aspect, allowing manufacturers to offer soaps at a lower price, it comes with significant downsides. The presence of sodium sulfate can make the soap more drying to the skin, as it tends to strip away natural oils. This can lead to skin irritation and discomfort, especially for those with sensitive skin. Furthermore, sodium sulfate does not contribute to the soap's cleansing ability, meaning it adds no real benefit to the end-user experience. As consumers become more aware of the ingredients in their skincare products, the inclusion of sodium sulfate may deter those seeking more natural and gentle options.
