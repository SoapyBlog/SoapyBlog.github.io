Infusing herbs into soap is a simple way to enhance its benefits and add natural scents and colors. To start, choose your favorite herbs, such as lavender, chamomile, or rosemary, based on the properties you want to include in your soap. Begin by drying the herbs thoroughly to prevent mold and bacteria growth. Once dried, you can infuse the herbs into oils by placing them in a jar and covering them with a carrier oil like olive or coconut oil. Seal the jar and let it sit in a warm, sunny spot for a few weeks, shaking it occasionally to help the infusion process. After the infusion period, strain the oil to remove the herbs. This infused oil can then be incorporated into your soap-making process, adding the desired herbal benefits and aromas. Using herb-infused oils in your soap not only enhances its natural qualities but also provides a personal touch to your homemade creations.
