Sodium cocoate is a key ingredient in soap making, derived from the saponification of coconut oil. It acts as a surfactant, helping to break down oils and dirt, allowing them to be easily rinsed away with water. Sodium cocoate is known for its ability to create a rich and foamy lather, making it a popular choice in many commercial and artisanal soaps. It is also valued for its moisturizing properties, as it helps to maintain the skin's natural moisture balance. By incorporating sodium cocoate into soap, you can create a product that is both effective in cleansing and gentle on the skin.
