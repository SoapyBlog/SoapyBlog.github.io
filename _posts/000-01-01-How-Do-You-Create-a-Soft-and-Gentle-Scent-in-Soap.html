To create a soft and gentle scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of calm and tranquility. Lavender, chamomile, and rose are excellent choices for their soothing and delicate aromas. You can blend these with a hint of vanilla or sandalwood to add warmth and depth. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a calming and comforting experience, perfect for unwinding and relaxing after a long day.
