To make soap with a smoky scent, start by selecting fragrance oils that capture the rich, earthy aroma of smoke. Popular choices include cedarwood, vetiver, and birch tar fragrance oils. These can be used individually or blended to create a unique smoky fragrance. When adding the fragrance oils to the soap mixture, do so at a low temperature to preserve their aromatic properties. Consider incorporating natural colorants like activated charcoal or cocoa powder to enhance the visual appeal of the soap. The result is a soap that exudes a deep, smoky scent, perfect for a bold and earthy bathing experience.
