Layering scents in soap is an art that involves combining different fragrances to create a complex and appealing aroma. To achieve this, start by selecting a base note, which is the foundation of your scent and usually consists of rich, deep aromas like vanilla or sandalwood. Next, choose a middle note, often floral or herbal, such as lavender or rosemary, to add depth and character. Finally, add a top note, which is the first scent noticed and tends to be fresh and light, like citrus or mint. When blending these layers, it's important to consider the strength and longevity of each note to ensure they complement rather than overpower each other. Experimenting with different combinations can lead to unique and personalized soap fragrances that captivate the senses. Remember to test small batches to refine your blend before committing to a larger production, ensuring the final product is both balanced and delightful.
