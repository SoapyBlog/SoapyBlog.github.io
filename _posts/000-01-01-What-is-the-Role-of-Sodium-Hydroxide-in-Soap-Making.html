Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, is an essential ingredient in soap making, as it is responsible for the saponification process. This chemical reaction occurs when sodium hydroxide is combined with fats or oils, transforming them into soap and glycerin. Without sodium hydroxide, the oils would not convert into soap, making it a crucial component in traditional soap making methods. While sodium hydroxide itself is a caustic substance, it is completely neutralized during the saponification process, resulting in a safe and effective cleansing product.
