Borage oil is a beneficial ingredient in soap due to its high concentration of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid known for its skin-soothing properties. This oil is particularly effective for dry or sensitive skin, as it helps to restore moisture and improve skin elasticity. Borage oil also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it ideal for calming irritated or inflamed skin conditions. By incorporating borage oil into soap, you can create a product that not only cleanses but also nourishes and revitalizes the skin, leaving it feeling soft, smooth, and healthy.
