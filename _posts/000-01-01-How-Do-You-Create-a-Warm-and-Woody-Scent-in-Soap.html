To create a warm and woody scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of comfort and grounding. Essential oils like cedarwood, sandalwood, and vetiver are excellent choices for their rich and woody aromas. You can blend these with a hint of spice or citrus to add complexity and balance. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a warm and comforting experience, perfect for those who enjoy a touch of nature in their fragrance.
