Proper storage of handmade soap is essential to maintain its quality and prolong its lifespan. To keep your soap in the best condition, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and humidity, as these can cause the soap to sweat or melt. It's advisable to use a well-ventilated container or a soap dish with drainage to allow air circulation, preventing the soap from becoming soggy. If you have multiple bars, consider wrapping each one in breathable paper to prevent them from sticking together. By following these simple storage tips, you can ensure your handmade soap remains fresh and effective for a longer period.
