Soap bubbles form due to the unique properties of soap molecules, which have both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. When soap is mixed with water, these molecules arrange themselves into a thin film with the hydrophilic ends facing the water and the hydrophobic ends facing away. This film traps air inside, creating a bubble. The surface tension of water is reduced by the soap, allowing the bubble to stretch and form. The colorful appearance of soap bubbles is due to light reflecting off the thin layers of soap film, creating a spectrum of colors. Soap bubbles are not only fun to play with but also demonstrate interesting scientific principles.
