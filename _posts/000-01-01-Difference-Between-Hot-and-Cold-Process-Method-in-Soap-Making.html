The main difference between the hot and cold process methods in soap making lies in how the soap mixture is treated during production. The cold process method involves mixing oils and lye without additional heat, allowing the mixture to saponify naturally over time. This method gives soap makers more control over the ingredients and allows for the inclusion of natural additives. On the other hand, the hot process method uses heat to speed up saponification. The soap mixture is cooked, often in a slow cooker, until it reaches a gel-like consistency. This method allows the soap to be used almost immediately after cooling, as the saponification is completed during the cooking phase. While the cold process is ideal for creating smooth, customizable soaps, the hot process is favored for its rustic appearance and shorter curing time. Additionally, fragrances and additives can be added after cooking in the hot process, preserving their scent and properties.
