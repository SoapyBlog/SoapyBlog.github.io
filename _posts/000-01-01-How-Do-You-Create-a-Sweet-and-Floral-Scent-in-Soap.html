To create a sweet and floral scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of romance and elegance. Essential oils like rose, ylang-ylang, and geranium are excellent choices for their rich and floral aromas. You can blend these with a hint of vanilla or citrus to add sweetness and balance. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a luxurious and captivating experience, perfect for those who enjoy a touch of romance in their fragrance.
