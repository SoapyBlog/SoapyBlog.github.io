Soap and detergent are both cleaning agents, but they differ in composition and usage. Soap is made from natural ingredients like fats and oils combined with an alkali, such as lye. This process, known as saponification, results in a product that is biodegradable and gentle on the skin. Soap is effective in soft water conditions but can form scum in hard water, reducing its cleaning efficiency. On the other hand, detergents are primarily synthetic, created from petrochemicals or oleochemicals. They are designed to perform well in both hard and soft water, making them more versatile for various cleaning tasks. Detergents are often used in laundry and dishwashing products due to their ability to break down grease and remove stains effectively. While there are some natural detergent options available, the majority are synthetic, offering powerful cleaning capabilities and a wide range of applications.
