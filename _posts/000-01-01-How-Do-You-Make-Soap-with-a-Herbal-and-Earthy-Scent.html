Creating a soap with a herbal and earthy scent involves selecting fragrances that are grounding and natural. Essential oils like rosemary, sage, and patchouli are excellent choices for their rich and earthy aromas. You can blend these with a hint of citrus or floral notes to add brightness and balance. When making the soap, incorporate these scents into the base mixture, ensuring they are evenly distributed. The result is a soap that envelops you in a herbal and earthy aroma, perfect for those who enjoy a connection to nature in their fragrance.
