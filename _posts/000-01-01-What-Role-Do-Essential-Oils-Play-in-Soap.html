Essential oils play a crucial role in soap by providing natural fragrances and therapeutic benefits. They are extracted from plants and can offer a range of scents, from floral to citrusy, enhancing the sensory experience of using the soap. Beyond their pleasant aromas, essential oils can also impart various skin benefits, such as antibacterial, antifungal, or soothing properties, depending on the type of oil used. This makes them a popular choice for soap makers looking to create products that are both aromatic and beneficial for the skin.
