Creating a musky scent in soap involves using fragrance oils that capture the deep, earthy aroma of musk. Popular choices include patchouli, sandalwood, and amber fragrance oils. These can be used individually or blended to create a unique musky fragrance. When adding the fragrance oils to the soap mixture, do so at a low temperature to preserve their aromatic properties. Consider blending musk with complementary scents like vanilla or lavender for a more complex aroma. The result is a soap that exudes a rich, musky scent, perfect for a warm and sensual bathing experience.
