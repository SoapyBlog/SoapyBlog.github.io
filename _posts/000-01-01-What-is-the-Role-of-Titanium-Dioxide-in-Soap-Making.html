Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂) is commonly used in soap making to create a bright white color in the final product. Its ability to produce a consistent and vibrant white makes it a popular choice for soap makers who want to achieve specific aesthetic effects, such as swirling or layering with other colors. However, there are both pros and cons to using TiO₂. On the positive side, it is a stable and effective pigment that does not react with other ingredients, ensuring that the soap's appearance remains unchanged over time. On the downside, some health concerns have been raised regarding TiO₂, particularly when used in its nanoparticle form, as it may pose respiratory risks if inhaled. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about its safety in personal care products. As a result, some soap makers and consumers choose to avoid TiO₂, opting for simpler and more natural colorants instead, to ensure a more organic and potentially safer product. This decision often aligns with a preference for natural and eco-friendly ingredients, reflecting a growing trend towards transparency and health consciousness in skincare.
