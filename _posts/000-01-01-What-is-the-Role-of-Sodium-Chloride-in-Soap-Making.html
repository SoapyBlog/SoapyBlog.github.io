Sodium chloride, commonly known as sea salt, plays a crucial role in soap making by helping to harden the soap bars. When added to the soap mixture, sodium chloride reduces the solubility of the soap, allowing it to solidify more quickly and maintain its shape. This results in a firmer, longer-lasting bar that is less likely to become mushy when exposed to water. Additionally, sodium chloride can enhance the soap's lathering properties, contributing to a richer and more luxurious foam. Its use in soap making is a simple yet effective way to improve the texture and durability of the final product.
