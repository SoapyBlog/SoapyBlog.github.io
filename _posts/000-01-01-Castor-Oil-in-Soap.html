Castor oil plays a crucial role in soap making due to its unique properties that enhance the quality of the final product. It is known for its ability to create a rich, creamy lather, which is highly desirable in soaps. This oil is also a humectant, meaning it helps attract and retain moisture, leaving the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Additionally, castor oil contributes to the hardness of the soap, ensuring it lasts longer and maintains its shape. Its natural conditioning properties make it an excellent choice for those with sensitive or dry skin, as it helps soothe and nourish. By incorporating castor oil into your soap recipes, you can create a luxurious and moisturizing product that enhances the bathing experience.
