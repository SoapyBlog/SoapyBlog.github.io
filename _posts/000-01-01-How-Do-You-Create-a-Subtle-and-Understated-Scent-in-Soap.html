To create a subtle and understated scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that are light and delicate. Essential oils like chamomile, lavender, and sandalwood are excellent choices for their gentle and soothing aromas. You can blend these with a hint of citrus or floral notes to add a touch of brightness. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a gentle and calming experience, perfect for those who prefer a more understated fragrance.
