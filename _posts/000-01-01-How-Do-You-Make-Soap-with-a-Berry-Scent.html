To make soap with a berry scent, start by selecting fragrance oils that capture the sweet and fruity aroma of berries. Popular choices include strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry fragrance oils. These can be used individually or blended to create a unique berry fragrance. When adding the fragrance oils to the soap mixture, do so at a low temperature to preserve their aromatic properties. Additionally, consider incorporating natural colorants like beetroot powder or alkanet root to enhance the visual appeal of the soap. The result is a delightful soap that exudes a sweet, berry scent, perfect for a refreshing and fruity bathing experience.
