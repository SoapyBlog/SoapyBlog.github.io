To create a deep and earthy scent in soap, focus on using essential oils that evoke a sense of grounding and warmth. Patchouli, cedarwood, and vetiver are excellent choices for their rich and earthy aromas. You can blend these with a hint of spice or citrus to add complexity and balance. When making the soap, add these essential oils to the base mixture, ensuring they are well incorporated. The result is a soap that provides a grounding and comforting experience, perfect for those seeking a connection to nature and a sense of tranquility.
