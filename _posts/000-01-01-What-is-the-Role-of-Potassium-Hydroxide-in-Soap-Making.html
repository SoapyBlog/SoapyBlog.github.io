Potassium hydroxide is used in soap making to produce liquid soaps and soft soaps. Similar to sodium hydroxide, it is responsible for the saponification process, converting fats and oils into soap. However, potassium hydroxide creates a softer soap that is more soluble in water, making it ideal for liquid soap formulations. It allows for the creation of products that are easy to use and rinse off, providing a convenient and effective cleansing experience. Potassium hydroxide is a key ingredient in crafting high-quality liquid soaps that offer versatility and ease of use.
