Natural soaps are often better for sensitive skin because they are made with gentle, skin-friendly ingredients that are less likely to cause irritation. Unlike commercial soaps that may contain harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and synthetic additives, natural soaps typically use plant-based oils, natural fragrances, and essential oils. These ingredients are known for their soothing properties and can help maintain the skin's natural balance without stripping away its protective oils. Natural soaps also often include nourishing elements like shea butter, aloe vera, and oatmeal, which can calm and moisturize sensitive skin. By avoiding harsh chemicals and focusing on natural ingredients, these soaps provide a milder, more soothing cleansing experience, making them an ideal choice for those with sensitive skin.
